So under this list, the responsibilities are as follows:

* Video Reviewer - The person who is expected to review the video.
* Host - The person that will moderate the live session, hosting the Q&A and moderating the chat.

In terms of FOSDEM's roles this means we will all still be "coordinators" of every talk (which should give us all the ability to moderate at any time in case it's needed).
The "host" role was added for each person that is hosting each talk.

### video review links and instructions

We need to watch the talks and check that they are okay. This is mainly checking for:
- Audio issues
- Video issues (ie. if the video suddenly goes black or distorted)
- Content violation (just make sure no-one have snuck porn or copyrighted material into a talk)

To review a video you simply go to the page for the event you are reviewing:
- [HPC from Python to Nim](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22/event/12770)
- [Nim concurrency](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22/event/12796)
- [Next generation micro-controller programming](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22/event/12844)
- [State of scientific computing in Nim 2022](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22/event/12845)
- [Pararules](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22/event/12840)
- [LibVF.IO: vGPU & SR-IOV on Consumer GPUs using Nim](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22/event/12538)
- [Polymorph: a compile time approach to entity-component-systems in Nim](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22/event/12839)
- [Nim Metaprogramming in the real world](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22/event/12500)
- [Potato Zombies](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22/event/12849)

Then scroll down to the video section, it will either be under the "Review" button or the "Final version" button (the uploader can also review their talk, this is a system that was originally built for reviewing the recording of the live talks which you where expected to do yourself as a speaker). If the video looks good make sure it is accepted and available under the "Final version" button. If the video has problems we need to contact the speaker and have them upload a fixed version.
