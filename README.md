## Project Details

**Title of devroom**: Nim Programming Language

**Elaborate description of proposed devroom (including possible topics)**:

Nim is a versatile language that can be both compiled to low-level languages
like C/C++/ObjC and to the web-oriented language JavaScript. This, along with
it's rich, static type system, optional and tunable GC, and its rich
meta-programming system, means that the language offers something for everyone.
Being used for everything from programming the tiniest micro-controllers to
high-performance applications and even creating rich interactive websites. Its
unique combination of features and the aforementioned meta-programming makes it
feel at home in pretty much every programming niche.

Looking back at the talks FOSDEM has had about Nim in the past we expect a
varied selection of talks ranging from the design of the language and compiler
itself by core developers all the way to the many aforementioned use-cases for
such a language. Previous FOSDEM talks:

- [(2021) Nim meta-programming for 0-cost abstraction on microcontrollers](https://archive.fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/nimdsl/)
- [(2020) Nim on everything, from microcontrollers to web-sites, C and JS as intermediary languages](https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/nimoneverything/)
- [(2020) Move semantics in Nim, Deterministic Memory Management](https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/nimmovesemantics/)
- [(2020) Designing an ultra low-overhead multithreading runtime for Nim, Exposing fine-grained parallelism for 32+ cores hardware via message passing](https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/nimultralowoverheadruntime/)
- [(2020) Async await in Nim, A demonstration of the flexibility metaprogramming can bring to a language](https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/asyncawaitnim/)
- [(2019) Metaprogramming with Nim](https://archive.fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/nim_metaprogramming/)
- [(2019) How to build your own Ethereum client, The development story of Nimbus](https://archive.fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/nimbus/)

**Why does it fit FOSDEM?**

The Nim programming language first saw the light of day in 2008, and has been
developed actively as an open source project ever since. In more recent years
it has reached the milestone 1.0 release in 2019, with latest version 1.6.0
released late 2021. The language has been open source since it's very
beginning, and is being developed by a group of volunteers along with a core
team of developers paid by donations from the community. The Nim community
itself has traditionally been very Euro-centric, with most of the core
developers and users from Europe. FOSDEM has previously been an annual meeting
ground for Nim users where many have been able to put a face to the nicknames
we interact with every day for the first time. With this userbase there is also
the possibility to transition into a physical room once FOSDEM is back
to being a physical event.

The Nim community has also organised its own conference, NimConf2020 and
NimConf2021, and the people behind this proposal have already helped out with
organising the "Minimalistic, Experimental and Emerging Languages devroom" at
FOSDEM 2020. This means that we're confident that the Nim language devroom at
FOSDEM 2022 will be a great success with high quality talks offering something
for everyone, not only existing Nim programmers.
