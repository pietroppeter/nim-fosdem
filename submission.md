## Project Details

**Title of devroom**: Nim Programming Language

**Elaborate description of proposed devroom (including possible topics)**:

The Nim programming language devroom has been a big hit with our community in
the years we have been so fortunate as to be allowed to host it. Featuring a
wide selection of talks ranging from core developers talking about the language
and its design, all the way to users showing off cool projects and ways Nim
benefit them in their work or hobby it has something for everyone. For many the
devroom works as a meeting place where people come together and discuss Nim in
real life, and as a great place for new users to come and dip their toes in to
the language and community. The project itself has been open source since the
begining and is driven forwards by companies and volounteers who use it in open
and closed source projects.

**Why does it fit FOSDEM?**

In the past we have worked together with the Minimalistic and Declarative
devroom organizers with great success, and in 2022 we organised our own devroom
in the online version of FOSDEM. Albeit not getting a devroom for the first few
years of physical FOSDEM after this we try again this year and hope for either
a half day for ourselves or to be paired with our great friends, or some new
ones.

Looking back at the talks FOSDEM has had about Nim in the past we see a
selection of the fascinating talks the room provides:

The language itself is a versatile language that can be both compiled to
low-level languages like C/C++/ObjC and to the web-oriented language
JavaScript. This, along with its rich, static type system, optional and tunable
GC, and its extensive meta-programming system, means that the language offers
something for everyone.  And it's being used for everything from programming
the tiniest micro-controllers to high-performance applications and even
creating rich interactive websites. Its unique combination of features and the
aforementioned meta-programming makes it feel at home in pretty much every
programming niche attracting developers from many different fields.


The Nim programming language first saw the light of day in 2008, and has been
developed actively as an open source project ever since. In more recent years
it has reached the milestone 1.0 release in 2019 and version 2.0 in 2023. The
language has been open source since its very beginning, and is being developed
by a group of volunteers along with a core team of developers paid by donations
from the community and companies using the language. The Nim community itself
has traditionally been very Euro-centric, with most of the core developers and
users from Europe. So FOSDEM has naturally become an annual meeting ground for
Nim users where many have been able to put a face to the nicknames we interact
with every day for the first time. Since the language doesn't have as many big
commercial sponsors as other languages it relies on the open source community
both for getting work done and for donations. This makes open source meeting
grounds like FOSDEM an important part of the Nim community culture.

**Preferred slot**: Half Day, Sunday morning
