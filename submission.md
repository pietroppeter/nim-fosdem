## Project Details

**Title of devroom**: Nim Programming Language

**Elaborate description of proposed devroom (including possible topics)**:

Nim is a versatile language that can be both compiled to low-level languages
like C/C++/ObjC and to the web-oriented language JavaScript. This, along with
its rich, static type system, optional and tunable GC, and its extensive
meta-programming system, means that the language offers something for everyone.
And it's being used for everything from programming the tiniest
micro-controllers to high-performance applications and even creating rich
interactive websites. Its unique combination of features and the aforementioned
meta-programming makes it feel at home in pretty much every programming niche.

Looking back at the talks FOSDEM has had about Nim in the past we expect a
varied selection of talks ranging from the design of the language and compiler
itself by the core developers all the way to talk by the many developers who
use Nim for the aforementioned use-cases for such a language. For an example of
talk topics see the talks from previous iterations of the devroom:
- [Schedule of Nim Programming Language devroom at FOSDEM 2022](https://archive.fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/nim_programming_language/)
- [Schedule of co-organized Declarative and Minimalistic Computing devroom at FOSDEM 2021](https://archive.fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/declarative_and_minimalistic_computing/)
- [Schedule of co-organized Minimalistic, Experimental, and Emerging Languages devroom at FOSDEM 2020 (physical)](https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/minimalistic_experimental_and_emerging_languages/)

**Why does it fit FOSDEM?**

The Nim programming language first saw the light of day in 2008, and has been
developed actively as an open source project ever since. In more recent years
it has reached the milestone 1.0 release in 2019 and version 2.0 is coming
along well. The language has been open source since its very beginning, and is
being developed by a group of volunteers along with a core team of developers
paid by donations from the community. The Nim community itself has
traditionally been very Euro-centric, with most of the core developers and
users from Europe. So FOSDEM has naturally become an annual meeting ground for
Nim users where many have been able to put a face to the nicknames we interact
with every day for the first time.  In 2022 we succesfully organized a virtual
devroom dedicated to Nim at Fosdem and we would like to have the opportunity to
go back to meeting at a physical event.

The Nim community has also organised its own conference (with editions in 2020,
2021 and an upcoming edition in October 2022) and the people behind this
proposal have already organized a Nim Devroom at FOSDEM 2022 and co-organized
both a virtual and physical room in the past. This makes us confident that the
Nim language devroom at FOSDEM 2023 will be a great success with high quality
talks offering something for everyone, not only existing Nim programmers.
