## Nim Devroom proposal for FOSDEM 2023

Hi all,
me and @PMunch are working again this year to organize
participation at [FOSDEM 2023](https://fosdem.org/2023/).
This year it will be a physical event (in Brussels, Sat and Sun, Feb 4th & 5th)
so it would be a nice moment to meet in person. :beer_emoji:

If anybody wants to help out the **submission deadline is in two days**,
this Tuesday, October 18th.
We are targeting a half day of talks either on
Saturday or Sunday.
As last year, we are using this repo to organize:
https://github.com/pietroppeter/nim-fosdem

You can also ping us in #fosdem channel on Discord/Matrix.

And for those who might be interested in submitting a talk,
start thinking about the topic
(deadline for talk submission - _if the devroom is accepted_ -
is likely at beginning of December, but then no hassle to record,
you just need to have your slides and yourself in Feb in Brussels)!

Note that talks will be streamed live for everyone's enjoyment.
